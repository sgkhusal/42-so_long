# 42_so_long

A small 2D game

## Game rules

* The playerâ€™s goal is to collect every collectible present on the map, then escape chosing the shortest possible route.
* The player moves in these 4 directions: up (keyboarde W), down (keyboarde S), left (keyboarde A), right (keyboarde D).
* If the player touchs an enemy he dies

## Requirements:
* [Minilibx](https://github.com/42sp/minilibx-linux) installed (for 42 students using Workspaces the library is already installed)
* Minilibx requires differents libraries depending on the OS as explained [here](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html)
* For Linux or Mac OS update Makefile as indicated [here](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html) in the installation and compilation parts.

### Running the game

If you are using Workspaces just
* run ```make bonus```
* run ```./so_long_bonus map.ber``` with the specific map of your choose

Map files are provided in ``assets/maps`` folder but you can create your own maps. 
The game only accepts a map in the \*ber format and the characters:
* 1 for walls
* 0 for empty space
* C for colletibles
* E for exit
* P for player

When there is more than one player position the last 'P' is set as the initial player position and the other 'P's are set as enemies.

Enjoy and have fun!
